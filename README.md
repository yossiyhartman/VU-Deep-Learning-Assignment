## Deep Learning Course Assignments â€“ VU Amsterdam
Welcome to my repository for the Deep Learning course at VU Amsterdam. This repo contains the assignments I worked on as part of the course, reflecting my progress in understanding and applying key concepts in neural networks, from the basics to more advanced models.

#### Pure Python Neural Network
An implementation of a basic neural network with one hidden layer, built entirely from scratch using Python. This assignment focuses on the core mechanics of neural networks, including forward and backward propagation, without relying on external libraries.

#### Numpy Neural Network
Building on the first version, this implementation uses numpy to handle computations more efficiently

#### Variational Autoencoder with PyTorch
A more advanced assignment exploring Variational Autoencoders.
